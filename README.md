# Code-201-proj

## This is a gussing game to evaluate the user trend and readablity to join a programming course. 

## This code has been modified by wrapping each indivisual question in a separate function; this was a pai programming job in which mohammad Adnan was the driver and Wasfi  was the navigator. 
## in pair programming, we added a score to the code to give the result of right answers the user done. this part was missed from Wasfi's code .
